The ‘Home’ page consists of 3 Features:
1. Patient 
2. Doctor 
3. Admin  

### Featues of Patient :

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This module allows patients to create their account, book an appointment to see a doctor and see their appointment history.
  The registration page(in the home page itself) asks patients to enter their First Name, Last Name, Email ID, Contact Number, Password and radio buttons to select their gender.

### Featues of doctor :

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The doctors can login into their account which can be done by toggling the tab from ‘Patient’ to ‘Doctor’. Figure below  shows the login form for a doctor. Registration of a doctor account can be done only by admin. We will discuss more about this in Admin Module.
